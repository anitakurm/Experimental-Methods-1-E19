### Part 1 Exerice: The Stroop Task
1. Read in all of your data (there is code for it below, but you are free to try making it yourself)
2. Think about a model you could build to test whether emotionally charged words increase reaction time compared to neutral words.
3. Discuss with people at your table
    - Which variables should be the fixed effects?
    - Which variables should be the random effects?
    - Which variables should be the random slope and random intercept?
    
4. Build the model

Optional: 
5. Check its residual plot: using command plot(model)
6. Build another model and compare which one is the best
7. Report the best model using write-up instructions from above




```{r}
#Read in all the csv files from a folder and bind them together
df <- list.files(path = "EmotionalStroopTask", pattern = "*.csv", full.names = T) %>% 
  lapply(read_csv) %>% 
  bind_rows()

df$Gender <- as.factor(df$Gender)
df$ID <- as.factor(df$ID)
df$Valence <- as.factor(df$Valence)
model <- lm(Reaction_time ~ Sentiment+Valence , data = df)
summary(model)

car::vif(model)

```
